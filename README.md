# Fast's Custom Commands
[ULX](https://github.com/TeamUlysses/ulx) is an admin mod for [Garry's Mod](http://garrysmod.com/).
This is a command expansion pack for ULX.

## Requirements
[ULX](https://github.com/TeamUlysses/ulx) is obviously needed to run these commands, along with its main dependency [ULib](https://github.com/TeamUlysses/ulib).<br>
Also, the command for rating players requires [SUI Scoreboard](https://github.com/ZionDevelopers/sui-scoreboard) to be usable.

## Installation

### Just put this repository in your server's addons folderâ€”simple and easy. &nbsp;After you have all the dependencies, restart the server and it should be good to go!
